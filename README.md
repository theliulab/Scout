# Project
<b>Scout</b> is a computational methodology that enables interactomic analysis by identifying mass spectra of peptides linked with cleavable cross-linking reagents. By leveraging machine learning techniques, Scout ensures a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) at multiple levels, including cross-linked spectrum matches, residue pairs, and PPIs. Our methodology offers an efficient and accurate solution for large-scale interactomics studies, addressing the existing computational challenges.
