# Procedures

1. **Software installation:**<br/>
Here, we provide the Liu Lab version [1.5.1](https://github.com/diogobor/Scout/releases/tag/1.5.1) of _Scout_.
Releases beyond version 1.5.1, uploaded on [this GitHub](https://github.com/diogobor/Scout), are independent, and as such **not supported** by our lab.
_Scout_ updates, developed by the Liu Lab, will be uploaded here in this repository.

1. **Workflow:**<br/>
The workflow demonstrates how to perform a search using _Scout_. [Access it here](https://github.com/diogobor/Scout/#readme).
